Dynamic Inventories for Scaling

Infrastructure is rarely static. Existing infrastructure is scaled out or up. New infrastructure is
deployed to support new applications or services. And sometimes new infrastructure just shows up.
You don’t always know what it’s for, but you manage it anyhow.

Each of those events requires modifications to the Ansible inventory. Adding hosts to the inventory
requires you to create a new entry in the hosts file and to assign it to the appropriate groups. While
doable, this can be cumbersome. Ansible solves the problem of inventory management with
dynamic inventories.

A dynamic inventory uses an external source to generate the Ansible inventory. That external
source can be your cloud provider, an IP address management (IPAM) and data center
infrastructure management (DCIM) tool such as Netbox, or even a custom script that generates
JSON that Ansible can parse as an inventory.
