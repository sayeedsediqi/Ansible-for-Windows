Take Inventory of the Infrastructure

Inventories describe your infrastructure by listing hosts and groups of hosts. Using an inventory
gives you the ability to share common variables among groups. Inventories are also parsable with
host patterns, giving you the ability to broadly or narrowly target your infrastructure with Ansible
automation. In its simplest form, an Ansible inventory is a file.

Example :
Within your infrastructure, you have three web servers and a database server. The Ansible
inventory might look like this:

ini inventory file
[webservers]
web01
web02
web03
[dbservers]
db01
